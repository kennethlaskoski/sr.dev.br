# sr.dev.br
### Open source resume generator

This is the source code for the [sr.dev.br](https://sr.dev.br) website, created by [Kenneth Laskoski](https://github.sr.dev.br), a computer programmer focused on mobile applications, specially iOS app development using the [Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/index.html) from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

The initial goal was to have a server for personal experimental/educational mobile projects. Then came the idea of using it to publish my resume and the natural thing to do, at least for me, was to create a resume generator application.

Bear in mind that this is a work in progress, not at all meant for production and ***I'm not a web developer***. Suggestions and critiques are welcomed but please be gentle.
